# Firmware Layout

This application targets an ESP32-C3 with 8 MB Flash. Its layout reserves
device-identity and audio storage in addition to the firmware and settings.

## Default layout

The checked-in `partitions.csv` contains:

| Partition | Type/subtype | Offset | Size | Purpose |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `nvs` | data/NVS | `0x9000` | `0x6000` | ESP-IDF and application key-value storage |
| `phy_init` | data/PHY | `0xF000` | `0x1000` | PHY initialization data |
| `factory` | app/factory | `0x10000` | `0x340000` | The single application image |
| `cardid` | data/0x40 | `0x350000` | `0x10000` | Reserved device identity data |
| `audio` | data/0x41 | `0x360000` | `0x4A0000` | Recorded audio storage |

There are no OTA slots. The Mac updater writes only the application at
`0x10000`, with `0x350000` as its exclusive upper bound. Changing these
boundaries requires updating the updater and its tests, not just this table.

## Custom layouts

Users may edit `partitions.csv` to resize, move, add, or remove partitions for
their application. A custom table may use OTA slots, filesystem/resource
partitions, or other application-specific data. Keep the 8 MB device boundary,
avoid overlaps, and make sure the application image is flashed at the start of
an app partition large enough to contain it. When a derivative changes its
layout, update that project's documentation and flashing instructions.

## Enforced validation

Run:

```bash
./tools/validate.sh --firmware
```

The check builds in an isolated directory, creates the merged image, reads the
configured image offsets from `flash_args`, validates the partition-table MD5,
partition bounds, unique labels, and non-overlap, then ensures the application
offset matches an app partition large enough to contain it. It intentionally
does not require the default partition list. CI runs the same gate.

Every image listed in `flash_args`, including user-defined resources and OTA
data, must exist, be nonempty and match the merged bytes at its configured
offset. Image ranges must stay within 8 MB and must not overlap. Additional
images must fit entirely inside a configured partition; an offset inside that
partition is allowed. Merely declaring a resource partition does not require a
preloaded image, but listing an image in `flash_args` makes it mandatory.

For initial installation, use `build/FoloToy-AI-Passport-full.bin` at `0x0`.
The similarly named app-only image does not contain a bootloader or partition
table; release packages include it explicitly for compatible updates at `0x10000`.

## Flashing and stored data

Firmware and user data are different. If existing NVS settings, application
records, or files must be kept, export or otherwise save them before flashing
using a method supported by that application. Not requiring an original-firmware
backup does not guarantee data preservation or authorize a full-chip erase.

The verified merged image is written from `0x0`. Because the merged file pads
the gaps between images, flashing it can reset the NVS and PHY data regions.
Use the merged image for blank-device provisioning or an intentional complete
refresh. During normal development, use segmented `idf.py flash` when existing
NVS state should be preserved; this also requires a compatible partition layout
and flash targets that do not overwrite those data regions. `idf.py erase-flash`
erases all user data. Do not add it as a routine prerequisite: use it only when
a complete erase is explicitly intended and any data that must be kept has
been saved.
